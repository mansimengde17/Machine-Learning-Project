# Machine-Learning-Project
This project leverages machine learning models to predict an individual's risk of developing diabetes using health and lifestyle indicators from the CDC's BRFSS 2015 dataset. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and a deployed web application built with Streamlit.
